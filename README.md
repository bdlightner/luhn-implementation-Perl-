Luhn algorithm (credit card check-digit) implemented in Perl

Sample Perl function "check_number()" to check a numeric character string of any length with Luhn check-digit at end of string plus sample Perl function "calc_digit()" to calculate check-digit character for a given character string. The sample "main" program accepts one or more number strings on the command line.*

Written to be compatible with either Perl 4 or Perl 5.

For an excellent description of the Luhn algorithm refer to the Wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm.
